# Pulse of Events

## Description
An android app that allows to acoustically monitor event streams

Think of it like a monitoring board made of hearable widgets. So the acoustic equivalent of a classical monitoring board. 

The app taps into live event streams and converts events to sounds. Using a plugin system each supported event stream is loaded as a plugin. The plugin defines how to consume the event stream, how to interpret single event properties and how that data is mapped into sounds generated by a buildin synthesizer. 
The app does _not_ contain an event data store in any form, it only monitors events streamed _live_. Many streams allow the selection of time ranges though which allows to replay events from the past. 

## Installation
This is a standard Android app. 

So the standard build process applies. Easiest is to clone this reporitory, load it into AndroidStudio as a project, have the IDE build and install the app onto a device, an emulated or a physical one. 

Precompiled packages will be provided in the form of APKs. The standard process of manually installing an APK into an Android device via the 'adb' utility applies. 

## Usage
Once installed on any android device you can load event soruces in form of plugins that are distributed as standalone files. Those files can either be downloaded to the device itself from where you can import them. Or you can directly download them via network from github. 
Each loaded event stream plugin offers a music player like control: a "play" button that starts consuming from this event stream. 
How the event data is transformed into sound is configured in the plugin definition, there is no means to somehow modify that configuration. 
The app's UI is simple, should be self explaining. 

## Contributions
I am more than happy to accept contributions to this little experiement. Just contact me about ideas, wishes, suggestions. Or even open a pull request here if you did some coding yourself. 
I will accept all contributions that do make sense and that do not in any way violate other's rights, general rules or raise other issues in any form. The decision is mine. 
Plugins need to be specific in their description of the event stream, the configuration and the mapping. 
Plugin engines have to be implemented in a generic way so that they can be reused for other plugins. 
I expect contributions to consider, obey and document the license of the provided material, espeically sound samples.

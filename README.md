# Pulse of Events

## Description
An android app that allows to acoustically monitor event streams

Think of it like a monitoring board made of hearable widgets. So the acoustic equivalent of a classical monitoring board. 

The app taps into live event streams and converts events to sounds. Using a plugin system each supported event stream is loaded as a "pulse" plugin. The pulse defines how to consume the event stream, how to interpret single event properties and how that data is mapped into sounds generated by a build-in synthesizer. 
The app does _not_ contain an event data store in any form, it only monitors events streamed _live_. Many streams allow the selection of time ranges though which allows to replay events from the past. 

## Installation
This is a standard Android app. 

So the standard build process applies. Easiest is to clone this repository, load it into AndroidStudio as a project, have the IDE build and install the app onto a device, an emulated or a physical one. 

Precompiled packages will be provided in the form of APKs. The standard process of manually installing an APK into an Android device via the 'adb' utility applies. 

## Usage
Once installed on any android device you can load event sources in form of "pulses" that are distributed as standalone files. Those files can directly be downloaded via network from github. Or, for development purpose, you can import local pulse files from the device itself.   

Each loaded pulse offers a music player like control: a "play"/"pause" button that starts consuming from the event stream configured in this pulse.
How the event data is transformed into sound is configured in the pulse definition, there is no means to somehow modify that configuration. You can only enable a visualization in addition to the audio that is generated. 

The app's UI is simple, should be self explaining. 

## Motivation
As you probably realized by now this whole idea does not make much sense ;-)
Don't always take things too serious. This is a fun project, a learning experiment. I wanted to try AI agent based coding for the first time honestly. 
And frankly I have to admit that I am deeply impressed. Quite unlike previous experiences with AI I made over the last years, when it comes to programming. 
This project has been coded completely by an AI, Gemini specifically, as it is integrated into AndroidStudio. I did not directly change a single line of code, nor did I invest much into setup or architecture. 

## Contributions
I am more than happy to accept contributions to this little experiment. Just contact me about ideas, wishes, suggestions. Or even open a pull request here if you did some coding yourself. 
I will accept all contributions that do make sense and that do not in any way violate other's rights, general rules or raise other issues in any form. The decision is mine. 
Pulses need to be specific in their description of the event stream, the configuration and the mapping. 
Pulses engines have to be implemented in a generic way so that they can be reused for other pulses. 
I expect contributions to consider, obey and document the license of the provided material, especially sound samples.
